  In todays society, video games have become a staple in many peoples hobby or even career.  The thing is many people are starting to get very bored of them.  The reason for this being that most video games now are just the same old copy of the games that came prior to it with nothing to to add to it.  One really good example of this would be the most recent installments of the Call of Duty franchise.  With each new year and each new game that comes out for that franchise, people obviously get excited for the game.  The problem being that it dies out very quickly as most of the people are underwhelmed with the content and get bored of this very quickly.

  Call of Duty Cold War was a game that was put out in November 13, 2020.  It was a game that had a lot of talk going into it, but when it came to the actual game it was nothing like what they said it would be.  I was someone who went through this as when I got the game and started to play it I was very much bored and dissapointed by it after 3 weeks.  I remember that before with old entries in the franchise they added enough content that it was enough to satisfy me and others till the next content drop was released.  They knew how to make enough content for the game, but with this entry to the series they failed to do that.

  In the past few years the most popular games out on the market have been battle royales.  Companies realize that these games are in at the moment as so they decide to make their own.  From Fortnite, to Apex Legends, to Call of Duty Warzone.  Apex Legends is one where they aren't really suffering from this as they implemented something into the Battle Royale that was never really seen before.  They added things that helped them to have a game that would last for a while and make sure that they updated the game and release content.
