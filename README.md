<h1> <strong>Repetition</strong></h1>
<p>
In todays society, video games have become a staple in many peoples life.  The thing is many people are starting to get very bored of them.  The reason for this being that most video games now are just the same old copy of the games that came prior to it.  One really good example of this would be the most recent installments of the Call of Duty franchise.  With each new year and each new game that comes out for that franchise, people obviously get excited for the game.  The problem being that it dies out very quickly as most of the people are underwhelmed with the content and get bored of this very quickly.
